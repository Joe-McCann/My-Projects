This was the first challenge problem for my intro to CS class
The problem given was to find all triplets of integers that when cubed were smaller than a given integer (the base case was 1,000,000).
For example, the number 20 returns that there are 3 triplets:
1 1 1 = 3
2 1 1 = 10
The program also prints the amount of time it took to come up with an answer
