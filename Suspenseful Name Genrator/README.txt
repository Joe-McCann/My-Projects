This was a dumb little program that I whipped up in 30 minutes for a family party; hence why its such a dirty code job.
Nevertheless, the code does what it is intended to do. Write down some names into the list "names" in the .py file and then run it.
A screen will then appear that when clicked will randomly choose a name from the list in a suspenseful way. Once a name is chosen,
it is removed from the list, as to avoid repetitions.
