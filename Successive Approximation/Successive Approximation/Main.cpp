/*
This program was designed to carry out one specific function, and as such
I put all the steps do the function into SuccessiveApproximation class header
file. Each function (though it gets a little messy at times) has a brief description
of its function in the code. All in all, it is in essance a procedural program, that uses
classes as a means to make the repetition of functions, and the passing of values
easier.
