A program to model how effective a certain shape of brownie pan will be at cooking browines that are evenly
heated; while factoring in how much space they take up. 

In order to add your own shape into the model, add a function handel to the cell arrary f. x is an independant variable of your function's values along the x-axis, where k is some scale factor. For all k>0, f(x) should be always less than k while -k< x < k
