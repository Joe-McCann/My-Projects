My favorite circuit I've ever made, this "thing" was an expanded design of an asynchronous toll collector Mr. Paterno had us build.

The story is, Mr. Paterno assigned us a toll collector that accepted dimes and nickles, and that took a toll of $.20. He then dared our class to make a toll collector that accepted all types of change, and had a toll of a dollar. 

While most people laughed at the joke, I decieded to take the challenge and built a circuit that accepted all coins (even $.50 coins) and had a PROGRAMMABLE toll of up to $1.27.

All in all this took me an absurd amount of time, but the drop - zero I received in the end was certainly worth it. 

Unfortunately, it is built on CircuitMaker, which has since gone bankrupt, however, I'll include a snapshot of what the thing looks like from zoomed 
out.

**Side comedic note, I found out the hard way on this circuit that though the pro version of circuit maker has no limit on the number of gates in a circuit, there is a limit on the size of the circuit.
