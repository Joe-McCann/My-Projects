This program is used to simulate the binary output of a Analog
to Digital Converter with the successive approximation method. To 
begin, decide whether you want to read the warnings or get information
about the program. Upon getting to the real portion of the program, 
you will need to supply 4 numbers:

Vin - The input voltage that would be put into the circuit

Vref - The reference voltage for the circuit, that will determine
what fraction the input voltage will be. 

Bit number - How many bits you output will be, affects the resolution
of the output.

Decimal Precision - How many decimal points you will round to. Ten is how much you
will normally need, with 15 maximum for large bit numbers

The program will output several pieces of analyzed information, as well as every step
the circuit would take itself.
